# pingify : Chrome addon for real time social media notification 
# Description: A chrome addon that notifies any new update on any opened tab in chrome and allows to quickyl switch to it
# Kws: addon, chrome, social media, tabs, easy , realtime, pingify
# Use cases:
	## user opens a non pingified tab
	## user open a pingified tab
	## user in on the current pingified tab
	## user moves away from the current pingified tab
	## user is busy doing his thing and an update occurs at pingified tab
	## user checks the notification and switches to the tab
	## user closes pingified tab
	## ajax request but no update on the tab title
	## ajax request but new title is not in valid formtat
	## no internet connection
# Components:
	popup.js: script that gets activated when user clicks the pingify icon in the toolbar
	background.js : acts like a modal and performs ajax listening and title value calcualtion
	popup.html: html for popup UI
	manifest.json : configuration file as per Google chrome recommendations

# Issues: 
	1. There is no tab title ajax update listener
	2. pooling or frequently checking title takes too much of memory
	3. I dont have much time to build a perfect solution :)
